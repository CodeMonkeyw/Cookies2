🍪 Memory-Efficient Cookie Clicker
A high-performance, lightweight recreation of the classic idle game. This version is stripped down to its core mechanics, optimized for low memory usage and maximum "clicks per second" without the bloat.

🚀 Features
Ultralight Engine: Minimal DOM manipulation for peak performance.

Core Mechanics: Click, accumulate, and automate your cookie production.

Basic Shop: Essential upgrades to scale your cookie empire.

Clean UI: Distraction-free interface focused on the numbers.

🛠 Planned Updates (Roadmap)
I am currently working on the following enhancements to improve gameplay while maintaining efficiency:

[ ] Bulk Purchasing: Buy upgrades in sets of 10 or 100 to speed up late-game progress.

[ ] Expanded Catalog: Adding a wider variety of items in the shop .

[ ] Persistence: Implementing localStorage so you never lose your progress on refresh.

[ ] Visual Flair: Adding lightweight SVG icons to the shop for better UX.

📦 Installation & Usage
Since this is a stripped-down web project, you can run it directly in your browser.

Clone the repository:

Bash

http://codemonkeyw.github.io/Cookies2/
Open index.html in any modern web browser.

🧠 Optimization Philosophy
This project avoids heavy frameworks and massive asset libraries. It uses:

Vanilla JavaScript for logic.

CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout.

Zero external dependencies.

🤝 Contributing
Suggestions for further memory optimizations are always welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and submit a Pull Request.

How to make this even better:
Add a Screenshot: If you have the game running, take a small screenshot and add it under the main title.

Add Badges: You can add badges for "License: MIT" or "Language: JavaScript" at the very top.

Would you like me to help you write the JavaScript code for the Local Storage or the Bulk Purchase logic next?
